## Constitutional Analysis

### Emergency Types and Triggers
1. **National Emergency (Article 352)**: Triggered by war, external aggression, or armed rebellion
2. **President's Rule (Article 356)**: Invoked when constitutional machinery fails in a state
3. **Financial Emergency (Article 360)**: Declared when financial stability or credit is threatened

### Key Safeguards
- **Parliamentary Approval**: All emergencies require legislative oversight
- **Time Limitations**: Built-in expiry dates with renewal requirements
- **Judicial Protection**: High Court powers cannot be suspended
- **Special Majorities**: Enhanced voting requirements for approval

### Constitutional Balance
The emergency provisions balance the need for effective crisis management with democratic safeguards, ensuring that extraordinary powers remain temporary and subject to legislative control.
