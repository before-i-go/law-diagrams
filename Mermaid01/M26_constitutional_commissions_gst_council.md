## Constitutional Significance

These constitutional bodies represent crucial institutional mechanisms for:

1. **Fiscal Federalism**: GST Council ensures cooperative federalism in taxation
2. **Financial Distribution**: Finance Commission maintains balance between Union and State finances
3. **Merit-based Governance**: Public Service Commissions ensure competent civil service recruitment
4. **Constitutional Balance**: Each body has specific composition ensuring representation and expertise
5. **Procedural Safeguards**: Detailed procedures prevent arbitrary decision-making

The weighted voting system in GST Council and consultation requirements for PSCs demonstrate constitutional commitment to both federal cooperation and merit-based administration.
