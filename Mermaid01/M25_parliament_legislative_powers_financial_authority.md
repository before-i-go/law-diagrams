## Key Constitutional Principles

### Legislative Supremacy with Federal Balance
- **Union List Exclusivity**: Parliament has exclusive power over subjects of national importance
- **Concurrent List Primacy**: Parliament laws prevail over state laws in case of conflict
- **Emergency Override**: Parliament can legislate on state subjects during emergencies
- **National Interest Exception**: Rajya Sabha can authorize Parliament to legislate on state subjects

### Financial Federalism
- **Constitutional Tax Distribution**: Systematic sharing of tax revenues between Union and States
- **GST Framework**: Special constitutional provision for goods and services tax
- **Grants-in-Aid System**: Parliament's power to provide financial assistance to states
- **Presidential Recommendation**: Required for all tax-related bills affecting states

### Administrative Coordination
- **Union Direction Powers**: Central government can direct states for law compliance
- **Inter-governmental Cooperation**: Provisions for Union-State and Inter-State cooperation
- **Dispute Resolution**: Constitutional mechanisms for resolving inter-state disputes
- **Emergency Coordination**: Enhanced central powers during national emergencies

This comprehensive framework ensures Parliament's central role in maintaining India's federal structure while preserving the balance between national unity and state autonomy.
