## Analysis Notes

This section provides the foundational structure of the Indian Constitution, showing:

1. **Hierarchical Organization**: The Constitution is systematically organized into Parts
2. **Territorial Framework**: Part I establishes the Union and state formation mechanisms
3. **Citizenship Framework**: Part II defines who are citizens and their rights
4. **Rights Framework**: Part III begins the fundamental rights structure

The diagram shows the logical flow from basic territorial organization to citizenship to fundamental rights, establishing the constitutional hierarchy.

## Key Constitutional Concepts Identified

- **Federal Structure**: Articles 1-4 establish the Union and mechanisms for state creation/modification
- **Citizenship Regime**: Articles 5-11 create comprehensive citizenship framework
- **Rights Architecture**: Articles 12+ establish fundamental rights with clear categorization
- **Systematic Organization**: Clear part-wise division showing constitutional logic

This structure forms the foundation for understanding the entire constitutional framework.
