### Part V: The Union - Executive Structure
**Presidential System Framework:**
- **Head of State**: President as constitutional head
- **Executive Power**: Vested in President but exercised through Council of Ministers
- **Electoral Process**: Indirect election through electoral college
- **Term and Qualifications**: Specific constitutional requirements

## Constitutional Significance

This structure establishes:
1. **Welfare State Vision**: Comprehensive directive principles for social justice
2. **Balanced Citizenship**: Rights complemented by duties
3. **Executive Framework**: Presidential system with parliamentary features
4. **Separation of Powers**: Clear distinction between executive and judiciary

The transition from non-justiciable principles to justiciable duties to actual government structure shows the Constitution's comprehensive approach to governance.
