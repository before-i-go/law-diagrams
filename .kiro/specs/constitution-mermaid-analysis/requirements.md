# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to systematically convert the Constitution of India into comprehensive visual diagrams using Mermaid syntax. The goal is to transform complex constitutional text into accessible visual representations that enhance understanding of India's constitutional framework, structures, processes, and relationships.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Systematic Text Analysis

**User Story:** As a constitutional researcher, I want the entire Constitution text to be systematically analyzed in manageable chunks, so that no constitutional provision is overlooked in the visualization process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the Constitution text THEN the system SHALL process exactly 20,115 lines from `RAWDATA/EnglishCOI202407_extracted_text.txt`
2. WHEN breaking down the analysis THEN the system SHALL create exactly 202 tasks with 100 lines each (except final task with 15 lines)
3. WHEN processing each task THEN the system SHALL read the assigned line range and analyze content for diagram-worthy concepts
4. WHEN completing each task THEN the system SHALL update the task tracking file with completion status
5. WHEN encountering constitutional concepts THEN the system SHALL evaluate whether content warrants Mermaid diagram creation

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Visual Documentation

**User Story:** As a legal educator, I want all major constitutional concepts converted into visual diagrams, so that students can better understand complex constitutional relationships and structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN encountering structural elements THEN the system SHALL create diagrams for constitutional hierarchy, government branches, institutional frameworks, and federal-state relationships
2. WHEN encountering process elements THEN the system SHALL create diagrams for legislative procedures, judicial processes, amendment procedures, and electoral processes
3. WHEN encountering conceptual elements THEN the system SHALL create diagrams for rights frameworks, emergency provisions, constitutional principles, and checks-and-balances systems
4. WHEN creating diagrams THEN the system SHALL use vertical (TD) layouts with balanced width-to-height ratios
5. WHEN organizing diagrams THEN the system SHALL use sequential numbering (M01, M02, etc.) and descriptive topic names

### Requirement 3: Quality Visual Standards

**User Story:** As a visual learner, I want all diagrams to follow consistent quality standards, so that I can easily read and understand the constitutional concepts being presented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating diagrams THEN the system SHALL use `graph TD` (Top-Down) direction for vertical flow
2. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL use vertical subgraphs to create compact, readable sections
3. WHEN connecting elements THEN the system SHALL minimize long horizontal connections between elements
4. WHEN styling diagrams THEN the system SHALL use consistent color schemes and visual conventions
5. WHEN labeling elements THEN the system SHALL include specific article numbers and clear descriptions

### Requirement 4: Systematic Progress Tracking

**User Story:** As a project manager, I want comprehensive progress tracking throughout the analysis, so that I can monitor completion status and ensure all tasks are properly documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN completing any task THEN the system SHALL update `MermaidTasks.md` with completion status
2. WHEN marking tasks complete THEN the system SHALL use `[x]` format with brief description of content and diagram creation status
3. WHEN updating progress THEN the system SHALL maintain accurate counters for completed tasks, diagrams created, and current focus
4. WHEN creating diagrams THEN the system SHALL increment diagram count and update file references
5. WHEN encountering issues THEN the system SHALL document any skipped tasks with reasoning

### Requirement 5: Organized File Management

**User Story:** As a documentation maintainer, I want all files organized in a clear structure with consistent naming, so that the constitutional diagrams are easy to navigate and reference.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating diagrams THEN the system SHALL store all files in `Mermaid01/` directory
2. WHEN naming files THEN the system SHALL use format `M[sequential_number]_[topic].md`
3. WHEN choosing topics THEN the system SHALL use lowercase with underscores, maximum 20 characters
4. WHEN documenting diagrams THEN the system SHALL include overview, key articles covered, and constitutional significance
5. WHEN organizing content THEN the system SHALL maintain clear directory structure for easy navigation

### Requirement 6: Constitutional Accuracy and Compliance

**User Story:** As a constitutional scholar, I want all diagrams to accurately reflect constitutional provisions, so that the visual representations are legally sound and educationally reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating diagrams THEN the system SHALL cross-reference with original constitutional text
2. WHEN representing relationships THEN the system SHALL verify accuracy of hierarchies and connections
3. WHEN documenting provisions THEN the system SHALL ensure compliance with current amendments up to 106th Amendment Act, 2023
4. WHEN describing processes THEN the system SHALL accurately reflect constitutional procedures and requirements
5. WHEN showing structures THEN the system SHALL correctly represent government institutions and their relationships

### Requirement 7: Comprehensive Coverage Validation

**User Story:** As a constitutional completeness auditor, I want verification that all major constitutional areas are covered, so that the visual documentation provides comprehensive constitutional understanding.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL have covered all major constitutional parts (I through XXII)
2. WHEN documenting coverage THEN the system SHALL track which constitutional sections have been addressed
3. WHEN identifying gaps THEN the system SHALL note any major constitutional concepts not yet visualized
4. WHEN completing the project THEN the system SHALL provide summary of constitutional areas covered
5. WHEN validating completeness THEN the system SHALL ensure no critical constitutional provisions are omitted
