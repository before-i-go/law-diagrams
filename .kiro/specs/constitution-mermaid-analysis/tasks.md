### Quality Standards:
- Use `graph TD` (Top-Down) direction for all diagrams
- Store diagrams as `M[number]_[topic].md` in `Mermaid01/` directory
- Include overview, key articles, and constitutional significance in each diagram
- Cross-reference with original constitutional text for accuracy
- Update progress tracking after every single task completion

- [ ] Update README with a thorough documentation of what has been covered - with some caveats - a good TOC is important - make it like minto pyramid principle - essence at top and details added layer by layer- also think how shreyas doshi would suggest user journeys in such a brilliant doc so this repo is of maximum use to people - also add a lot of mermaid diagrams in README.md from top itself to make it very interesting to read - use -> .kiro/specs/constitution-mermaid-analysis/tasks.md - > .kiro/steering/mermaid-design-patterns.md -> .kiro/steering/mermaid-status-report.md
.kiro/steering/mermaid-syntax-guide.md ->  .kiro/steering/mermaid-troubleshooting.md. Mention that we converted .zzRef/EnglishCOI_20240716890312078.pdf to a txt - and hence some errors migth be there due to parsing. Put caveats + invite correction.
